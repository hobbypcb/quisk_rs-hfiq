# Quisk Python interface for the [RS-HFIQ 5W HF SDR Transceiver] (http://www.hobbypcb.com/rs-hfiq) 

**WIP:**  Interface mostly working, but haven't hashed out the Quirks interface.

## Known Limitations:
*  Serial post currently hard coded
*  Had to piggy-back on an existing radio definition to come up until a custom one is crated
*  Transmit not full enabled
